<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The projectâ€™s goal aimed to convert a raw dataset that held information on Titanic passengers into an application for the user to explore on their own. The dataset holds personal information on each passenger along with other factors that may correlate with whether they survived. The primary goal was to hand over control to an arbitrary viewer. The application is a graph with multiple y-axes where the user decided which factors display on the graph. Survival is depicted by color. As a result, trends are revealed throughout the infographic for the user to explore and conduct further research on their own if they wish. <p>
